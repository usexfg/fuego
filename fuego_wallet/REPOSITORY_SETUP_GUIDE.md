✅ **Professional documentation** (README, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG)  
✅ **License and .gitignore** configured  
✅ **Production-ready codebase** with all features implemented  

## 🔥 Create GitHub Repository

### Option 1: GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub** → [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)

2. **Repository Details:**
   ```

   ❌ Add .gitignore (we already have one)  
   ❌ Choose a license (we already have MIT)
   ```

3. **Click "Create repository"**

### Option 2: GitHub CLI (If you have it installed)

```bash
gh repo create usexfg/fuego-flutter --public --description "🔥 Complete Flutter mobile wallet for Fuego (XFG) cryptocurrency"
```

## 🔄 Push Your Code

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory (if not already there)
cd /workspace/fuego_wallet

# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/usexfg/fuego-flutter.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🏷️ Create Release Tag

Create the first release tag for v1.0.0:

```bash
# Create and push the v1.0.0 tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "🎉 Fuego Flutter Wallet v1.0.0 - Complete mobile wallet with advanced security, privacy transactions, Elderfier staking, encrypted messaging, and mining"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## 📝 Post-Creation Setup

### 1. Repository Settings

Go to **Settings** tab in your GitHub repository:

- **General** → Enable "Issues" and "Discussions"
- **Security** → Enable "Vulnerability reporting"
- **Pages** → Set up GitHub Pages for documentation (optional)

### 2. Repository Topics

Add these topics to help discovery:
```

Protect the `main` branch:
- Go to **Settings** → **Branches** → **Add rule**
- Branch name pattern: `main`
- ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging

## 🔄 CI/CD Setup (Optional but Recommended)

  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:

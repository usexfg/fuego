PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS, DECENTRALIZED BANKING, & SECURE MESSAGING

Fuego is a decentralized blockchain bank with ledger deposits paying interest, without involvement of legacy financial institutions, powered by 100% open source code.

Fuego network enables secure untraceable transfer of funds and anonymous messaging using a distributed public ledger. Both sender and receiver are kept anonymous, a key concern in a post Snowden world.
Hackers cannot trace money or messages though they are sent across public networks.

Fuego ($XFG) is based on the Cryptonote protocol and operates as a secure peer-to-peer network with no central authority. Only you control the private keys to your funds.

No one owns the Fuego network and everyone can take part.  Fuego is open-source, community driven and truly decentralized - accessible by anyone in the world regardless of their geographic location or status.
Fuego blockchain is resistant to any kind of analysis.  All your transactions and messages are fully anonymous.
